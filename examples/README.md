## File Descriptions

### content.md
The original content/source material for the presentation:
- Slide-by-slide breakdown of content
- Key messages and data points
- Design suggestions for AI rendering
- References to original sources

### *.mu Files
Mockup files generated by different AI models from the same content.md:
- `claude.mu` - Generated by Claude
- `gpt.mu` - Generated by GPT-4/GPT-4o
- `gemini.mu` - Generated by Gemini

This allows comparison of how different AI models interpret the same content.

### renders/
Rendered slide images from each AI:
- PNG format, 1920x1080 recommended
- One image per slide
- Organized by AI model

## How to Use

### 1. Study the Content
Read `content.md` to understand the original material and slide structure.

### 2. Generate .mu Files
Use your preferred AI with mockup.md to generate a .mu file:
```
Based on this content, generate a .mu presentation:
[paste content.md]
```

### 3. Render Images
Ask the AI to render the .mu file:
```
Render this .mu file as presentation slides:
[paste .mu file]
```

### 4. Compare Results
Compare outputs across different AI models to see variations in:
- Layout interpretation
- Visual styling
- Color choices
- Typography

## Contributing

### Adding New Examples
1. Create a numbered directory (e.g., `09-new-example/`)
2. Write `content.md` with slide-by-slide content
3. Create empty `renders/` subdirectories
4. Update this README

### Contributing AI Outputs
1. Generate .mu file and name it `{ai-model}.mu`
2. Generate rendered images in `renders/{ai-model}/`
3. Add a `metadata.json` with generation details:
   ```json
   {
     "model": "claude-opus-4.5",
     "date": "2026-02-01",
     "mockup_version": "1.0",
     "notes": "Any special observations"
   }
   ```
4. Submit a pull request

## Legacy Examples

The original examples (intro, tech-rfc, thesis-defense, mapreduce) have been moved/reorganized. They demonstrated:
- Basic mockup.md syntax
- Various presentation types
- ASCII diagram techniques
