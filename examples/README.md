## About Original Slides

The `original/` folders contain authentic slides from official sources. These are used as **reference material** to demonstrate that mockup.md can reproduce similar results.

The workflow to create these examples:
1. AI reads original PDF slides (visual layout)
2. AI generates `.mu` file directly from the layout
3. AI renders `.mu` to images
4. Compare rendered images with originals

This is **NOT** the typical mockup.md workflow. It's just for demonstration purposes.

## Typical Mockup.md Workflow

In normal usage, you simply chat with AI:

```
User: Create a 5-slide pitch deck for my startup
  ↓
AI generates .mu file
  ↓
AI renders slides
```

Or discuss content first:

```
User: Help me plan a technical presentation about X
  ↓
Discuss and create content.md
  ↓
AI generates .mu file
  ↓
AI renders slides
```
