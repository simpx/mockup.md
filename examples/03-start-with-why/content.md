## Slide 1: Title

**Start with Why**

*How Great Leaders Inspire Action*

Simon Sinek

TED Talk | 2009

---

## Slide 2: The Question

**A Simple Question**

Why is it that some people and organizations are more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others?

Why is it that some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike?

Why are some leaders able to inspire where others aren't?

**It's not luck. It's a pattern.**

## Slide 3: The Golden Circle

**The Golden Circle**

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
        │                                 │
        │     ┌───────────────────┐       │
        │     │                   │       │
        │     │    ┌─────────┐    │       │
        │     │    │         │    │       │
        │     │    │   WHY   │    │       │
        │     │    │         │    │       │
        │     │    └─────────┘    │       │
        │     │        HOW        │       │
        │     │                   │       │
        │     └───────────────────┘       │
        │              WHAT               │
        │                                 │
        └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **WHAT**: Products, services, job functions - Everyone knows WHAT they do
- **HOW**: Differentiating value proposition - Some know HOW they do it
- **WHY**: Purpose, cause, belief - Very few know WHY they do it

## Slide 4: Most Organizations

**How Most Organizations Think**

Outside-In: WHAT → HOW → WHY

```
"We make great computers.        (WHAT)
They're beautifully designed,    (HOW)
user friendly.
Want to buy one?"

       WHAT ──▶ HOW ──▶ WHY?
         ▼
    🤷 Uninspiring
```

This is how most marketing works:
- Here's our product
- Here's why it's better
- Buy it

**Result**: Competing on features and price.

---

## Slide 5: Inspired Organizations

**How Inspired Leaders Think**

Inside-Out: WHY → HOW → WHAT

```
"Everything we do, we believe    (WHY)
in challenging the status quo.
We believe in thinking differently.

The way we challenge the          (HOW)
status quo is by making our
products beautifully designed
and user friendly.

We just happen to make           (WHAT)
great computers.
Want to buy one?"

       WHY ──▶ HOW ──▶ WHAT
         ▼
    ❤️ Inspiring!
```

**Same information, completely different impact.**

---

## Slide 6: The Biology

**The Biology Behind It**

The Golden Circle maps perfectly to human brain:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                        │
│   Neocortex (WHAT)                     │
│   • Rational thought                   │
│   • Language                           │
│   • Analytical thinking                │
│                                        │
│     ┌────────────────────────┐         │
│     │                        │         │
│     │  Limbic Brain          │         │
│     │  (WHY & HOW)           │         │
│     │  • Feelings            │         │
│     │  • Trust               │         │
│     │  • Decision-making     │         │
│     │  • NO language         │         │
│     │                        │         │
│     └────────────────────────┘         │
│                                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight**: We make decisions with our limbic brain (gut feelings), then rationalize with neocortex.

"People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it."

---

## Slide 7: Proof - Apple

**Proof: Apple**

Why is Apple so innovative?

| Aspect | Other Tech Companies | Apple |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Access to talent | Same | Same |
| Access to resources | Same | Same |
| Consultants | Same | Same |
| Media | Same | Same |

**The difference**: Apple starts with WHY.

Apple's products are just proof of their belief.
That's why we buy computers, phones, MP3 players, and tablets from a computer company.

---

## Slide 8: Proof - Wright Brothers

**Proof: The Wright Brothers**

The race to achieve powered flight:

**Samuel Langley** (well-resourced)
- War Department funding
- Best scientific minds
- NYT followed him everywhere
- Motivated by fame & fortune

**Wright Brothers** (under-resourced)
- No funding
- Bicycle shop mechanics
- Team paid with own money
- Motivated by a CAUSE

```
Resources:  Langley ▶▶▶▶▶ >>> Wright Brothers
Belief:     Langley <<< ◀◀◀◀◀ Wright Brothers
```

**Result**: Wrights succeeded. Langley quit when he heard the news.

"If you're motivated by the money, you quit when it gets hard."

---

## Slide 9: Proof - MLK

**Proof: Martin Luther King Jr.**

**August 28, 1963**: 250,000 people showed up on the National Mall

- No invitations
- No website to check the date
- People came for THEMSELVES

Dr. King didn't tell people WHAT needed to change in America.
He told people WHAT he believed.

"I have a **dream**"
NOT "I have a **plan**"

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  "I believe..."                     │
│         │                           │
│         ▼                           │
│  People who believed the same       │
│         │                           │

│         │                           │
│         ▼                           │
│  Showed up for themselves           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

## Slide 10: Law of Diffusion

**The Law of Diffusion of Innovation**

```
                          ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
                          │                                     │

                        Tipping Point ↑
                             (15-18%)
```

**Key insight**: You don't need to convince everyone. You need the first 15-18% who believe what you believe.

Early majority won't try until someone else has tried first.

## Slide 11: TiVo Failure

**Why TiVo Failed**

TiVo: First-mover, best product, well-funded

Their pitch (WHAT-focused):
> "We have a product that pauses live TV, skips commercials, rewinds, and memorizes your viewing habits."

Consumer response: "I don't believe you."

**TiVo should have said**:
> "If you're the kind of person who likes total control over every aspect of your life, we have a product for you."

**Result**: TiVo is a commercial failure despite superior product.

## Slide 13: The WHY Framework

**Finding Your WHY**

Questions to discover your WHY:

1. **Why does your organization exist?**
   (Not to make money—that's a result)

2. **Why do you get out of bed every morning?**

3. **Why should anyone care?**

```

## Slide 14: Summary

**Key Takeaways**

1. **People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.**

2. **The goal is not to sell to people who need what you have. The goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.**

3. **If you hire people just because they can do a job, they'll work for your money. But if you hire people who believe what you believe, they'll work with blood, sweat, and tears.**

4. **What you do simply proves what you believe.**

5. **The goal is not to be better than the competition. The goal is to be better than yourself.**

**"Those who start with WHY never manipulate, they inspire."**

## 设计建议

- **配色**: 金色/黄色作为 WHY 的强调色，形成"黄金圈"视觉效果
- **字体**: 大号粗体用于金句，保持简洁
- **图表**: 黄金圈同心圆图是核心视觉元素
- **照片**: 可加入 Jobs、MLK、Wright Brothers 的历史照片
- **动画**: 黄金圈可以从内到外逐层展开
